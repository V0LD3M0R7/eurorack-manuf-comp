Compilation of useful files, websites, data sheets, and much more for making eurorack modules

## Intro

So... you've come to the conclusion that making an affort to make your own modules is better than spending hard earned Frenklins and buying them. Good choice! It does't take a NASA  engineer to make these things so why can't YOU do it. People are making their own modules for decades - lot of them without technical background. But if you want to do this and make it right, you at least need to learn the basics of electronics and have an idea of what you are trying to create. And trust me, the latter is very important.
