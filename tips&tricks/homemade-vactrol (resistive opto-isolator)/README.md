# Homemade vactrol

Making a homemade Vactrol (whitch is a old brand name for [resistive opto-isolator](httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiResistive_opto-isolator)) is pretty straight forward:

1. get a [photoresistor (LDR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) of your choosing
2. get a LED with parameters of your choosing (LDRs react most effectively to yellow light)
3. prepear a small piece of **BLACK** heat-shrink
4.
