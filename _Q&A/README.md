# Questions & Answers

## 1. Should I learn something before I start making stuff?

- If you don't know anything about electricity, you should probably start there. You don't necessarily need to know every equation and every physical law of electricity, but you should probably at least know [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law). The rest you can learn from jump-start tutorial in resources folder.

- Talking about electricity, you don't need to know every single electronic component on earth and know exactly what is does. You should pick a thing you want to make so you can create sound.
